        <p>Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, 
            the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport. 
            Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables.
